    <!-- Only one database can be specified, and one must be specified. It is assumed the correct database driver is loaded in the classpath,
    and as of today, only oracle is provided and assumed. To add other database vendor support, we must ensure SQL compatibility and provide
    a list of reserved words so the database table can be created and verified

    The user must have permissions to create and alter the table specified, since it will be fixed if something is missing or the wrong size
    The DefaultTable must follow oracles rules for table names:
    An acceptable Oracle name must:

        Not be a reserved keyword. You cannot, for example, name your table TABLE or PROCEDURE or VARCHAR2.
        Be no longer than 30 characters.
        Begin with an alphabetical character. You can have numbers and certain special characters in the name, but the first character must be an alpha character.
        Contain only alphabetical characters, numbers, or one of the following special characters: # $ _
